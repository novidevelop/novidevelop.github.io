Hashtags are the backbone of TikTok's content organization and discovery system. The Fast TikTok API's `HASHTAG`
scraping type allows you to retrieve videos associated with a specific hashtag, providing a powerful way to analyze
niche communities, track campaigns, and understand content themes. This guide focuses on using the API's input UI for
the `HASHTAG` type. Check out [The Fast TikTok API](https://apify.com/novi/fast-tiktok-api).

## Why Scrape Hashtags?

Hashtag scraping offers several benefits:

* **Niche Content Discovery:** Find videos related to very specific topics.
* **Campaign Tracking:** Monitor the performance of branded hashtags.
* **Competitor Analysis:** See what hashtags your competitors are using and the content they're creating.
* **Community Identification:**  Discover active communities built around specific interests.
* **Content Inspiration:**  Find ideas for your own TikTok content.

## Key Input Fields for HASHTAG

When you select `HASHTAG` in the "Choose Scrapping Type" (`type`) field, the following input fields become relevant:

1. **`type` (Choose Scrapping Type):** Set this to `HASHTAG`.

2. **`url` (Start URL to scrape):** This is where you provide the URL of the TikTok hashtag page. The format
   is `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/[hashtagname]`. For example, for the hashtag `#datascience`, the URL would
   be `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datascience`.  *It's crucial to get this URL correct.* You can easily find this URL by
   searching for the hashtag on the TikTok website and copying the URL from your browser's address bar.

3. **`limit` (limit):** Under the "Number of videos per search" section (click the `>` to expand). This sets a *soft
   limit* on the number of videos the API will retrieve. It will get *at least* this many videos.

4. **`isUnlimited` (Is Unlimited):** Also under "Number of videos per search."  Setting this to `true` instructs the API
   to retrieve *all* videos associated with the hashtag.  **Be very cautious with this option.**  Popular hashtags can
   have thousands or even millions of videos, leading to extremely long processing times and potentially exceeding rate
   limits. Always start with limit.

**Here's a visual representation of the input UI with the relevant sections expanded:**

Notice that `region`, `keyword`, `sortType`, `publishTime`, and `urls` are *not* used with the `HASHTAG` type.

## Example Scenarios

**Example 1: Get the first 30 videos associated with the hashtag #travelphotography.**

1. Find the hashtag URL: Go to TikTok and search for `#travelphotography`. The URL will be something
   like `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/travelphotography`.
2. Configure the input:
    * `type`: `HASHTAG`
    * `url`: `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/travelphotography`
    * `limit`: `30`
    * `isUnlimited`: `false`

**Example 2:  Attempt to retrieve *all* videos for the hashtag #fyp (For You Page) – use with extreme caution!**

* `type`: `HASHTAG`
* `url`: `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp`
* `limit`: `100` (Start with a small limit for testing!)
* `isUnlimited`: `true` (Only after testing – this could take a *very* long time)

**Example 3: Retrieve at least 100 videos for a custom, less popular hashtag, #MyUniqueBrand.**

* `type`: `HASHTAG`
* `url`: `https://www.tiktok.com/tag/MyUniqueBrand`
* `limit`: `100`
* `isUnlimited`: `false`

## Tips and Best Practices

* **Verify the Hashtag URL:**  Always double-check the URL you're using. A small typo can lead to no results or
  incorrect results.
* **`isUnlimited` with Caution:**  Be extremely careful with the `isUnlimited` option, especially for popular hashtags.
  Start with a small `limit` to test and gauge the volume of content.
* **Hashtag Variations:** Consider scraping variations of your target hashtag (e.g., #datascience,
  #datasciencecommunity, #datasciencetips).
* **Combine with Other Scrape Types:**  After identifying influential users within a hashtag, you could use the `USER`
  scrape type to gather more data about their content.

## Conclusion

[The Fast TikTok API](https://apify.com/novi/fast-tiktok-api)'s `HASHTAG` input is a powerful tool for delving into specific TikTok communities and content
categories. By understanding the importance of the `url` field and carefully managing the `limit` and `isUnlimited`
options, you can effectively gather valuable data for your projects. Remember to start small, test thoroughly, and be
mindful of TikTok's rate limits.
