## What Can You Do with the Fast TikTok Scraper?

This actor offers a versatile approach to TikTok data extraction, catering to various needs. Here's a breakdown of the scraping types you can choose from:

* **Search:** Need to find videos related to specific keywords? The `SEARCH` option lets you scrape videos based on your queries, complete with options to filter by region, sort order (relevance, most liked, most recent), and even publication time.
* **Trend:** Stay ahead of the curve by identifying the hottest videos in your target country. The `TREND` scraping type allows you to capture the pulse of TikTok's trending content in a specific region.
* **Hashtag:** Want to analyze the performance and content associated with a particular hashtag? Simply provide the hashtag URL, and the actor will extract relevant videos.
* **User:** Curious about a specific TikTok creator's content? By providing their profile URL, you can scrape their videos and gain insights into their posting patterns and popular content.
* **Music:** Interested in videos using a specific song or sound? The `MUSIC` scraping type lets you extract videos associated with a particular music track URL.

## Key Input Parameters at Your Fingertips

The Fast TikTok Scraper is designed to be user-friendly, with a clear set of input parameters that allow you to tailor your scraping tasks precisely. Here's a quick overview of the essential options:

* **Choose Scrapping Type (`type`):** This is the most crucial parameter, allowing you to select the type of data you want to extract (SEARCH, TREND, HASHTAG, USER, MUSIC).
* **Target country. For TREND, SEARCH (`region`):** If you're scraping trends or performing a search, you can specify a 2-character region code (e.g., "US" for the United States, "GB" for the United Kingdom) to focus your results.
* **Start URL to scrape. For HASHTAG, USER, MUSIC (`url`):** When scraping hashtags, user profiles, or music, you'll need to provide the corresponding TikTok URL.
* **Keyword (can contain space). For SEARCH (`keywords`):** For search scraping, you can provide a list of keywords (e.g., "marketing tips", "funny cats") to find relevant videos.
* **Max Items (`maxItems`):** Set a soft limit on the number of videos you want to extract per scrape. This helps you control the amount of data and potentially the cost.
* **Is Unlimited (`isUnlimited`):** If you need to extract as many videos as possible, you can enable this option. However, be aware that this might take longer due to TikTok's anti-scraping measures.
* **Sort Type. Use when Type is SEARCH. (`sortType`):** When performing a search, you can choose to sort results by relevance, most likes, or most recent.
* **Publish Time. Use when Type is SEARCH. (`publishTime`):** Further refine your search results by filtering based on the video's publish date (e.g., "YESTERDAY", "WEEK", "MONTH").
