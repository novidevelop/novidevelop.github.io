[The Fast TikTok API](https://apify.com/novi/fast-tiktok-api)'s `COMMENT` scraping type allows you to retrieve comments from a specific TikTok video. This is
invaluable for sentiment analysis, understanding audience reactions, identifying key themes in discussions, and
gathering feedback. This guide focuses on using the API's input UI for the `COMMENT` type.

## Why Scrape Comments?

Comments provide a rich source of qualitative data:

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Gauge the overall positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards a video.
* **Audience Feedback:**  Understand what viewers liked or disliked about the content.
* **Identifying Key Themes:**  Discover recurring topics and opinions in the comments.
* **Community Engagement:**  Analyze how users interact with each other in the comments section.
* **Detecting Spam/Bots:** Identify potentially automated or spam comments.

## Key Input Fields for COMMENT

When you select `COMMENT` in the "Choose Scrapping Type" (`type`) field, these are the important fields:

1. **`type` (Choose Scrapping Type):** Set this to `COMMENT`.

2. **`url` (Start URL to scrape):**  Provide the URL (or video ID) of the TikTok video *whose comments you want to scrape*. The format
   is `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/videoid` or `videoid`. For
   instance: `https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio/video/7198765432109876543` or `9876543210987654321`.  *Get this URL exactly right.* You can
   find it by going to the video on the TikTok website and copying the URL from your browser.

3. **`limit` (limit):**  Under the "Number of comments per search" section (click the `>` to expand). This is a *soft
   limit*. The API will retrieve *at least* this many comments.

4. **`isUnlimited` (Is Unlimited):**  Also under "Number of comments per search."  Setting this to `true` tells the API
   to try to retrieve *all* comments for the video. **Be extremely cautious:**  Videos with high engagement can have
   *thousands* of comments, leading to very long processing times and potential rate limits. Start with a limit.

**UI Overview:**

The fields `region`, `keyword`, `sortType`, `publishTime`, and `urls` are *not* used with the `COMMENT` type.

## Example Scenarios

**Example 1: Get the first 50 comments from a specific video.**

1. Find the video URL: Go to the video on TikTok and copy the URL from your browser (
   e.g., `https://www.tiktok.com/@someuser/video/1234567890123456789`).
2. Configure the input:
    * `type`: `COMMENT`
    * `url`: `https://www.tiktok.com/@someuser/video/1234567890123456789` (replace with the actual URL)
    * `limit`: `50`
    * `isUnlimited`: `false`

**Example 2:  Attempt to retrieve *all* comments from a viral video (use with extreme caution!).**

* `type`: `COMMENT`
* `url`: `9876543210987654321` (replace with the actual video ID)
* `limit`: `100` (Always start with a limit for testing)
* `isUnlimited`: `true` (Only after testing!)
  **Example 3:  Attempt to retrieve at least 150 comments from a video**

* `type`: `COMMENT`
* `url`: `https://www.tiktok.com/@anothervideo/video/9876543210987654321` (replace with the actual URL)
* `limit`: `150`
* `isUnlimited`: `false`

## Tips and Considerations

* **URL Accuracy:**  The most common error is an incorrect video URL. Double-check it!
* **`isUnlimited` ‚Äì A Double-Edged Sword:** Be *very* careful with this option. Start with a small `limit` to understand
  the comment volume and the API's response time.
* **Comment Filtering:** The API retrieves comments as they appear on TikTok. You might need to do additional filtering
  and cleaning in your code to remove irrelevant comments or spam.
* **Nested Comments:** TikTok comments can have replies (nested comments). The API may or may not retrieve all levels of
  nesting ‚Äì check the API documentation for specifics. You might need to make multiple requests to get all replies.

## Conclusion

[The Fast TikTok API](https://apify.com/novi/fast-tiktok-api)'s `COMMENT` input provides access to a wealth of qualitative data from TikTok video comments. By
correctly providing the video URL and thoughtfully managing the `limit` and `isUnlimited` settings, you can gain
valuable insights into audience sentiment, feedback, and engagement. Always remember to start with a small scope and
test thoroughly, especially when dealing with potentially large numbers of comments.
